## Examples (Implemented)

### CameraCalibration
A checker-board is from https://www.mrpt.org/downloads/camera-calibration-checker-board_9x7.pdf .
It supports pinhole and fisheye camera models and undistortion is alse performed.

### Triangulation
This code generates 3d-points and camera poses by 2-viewes-geometry. You can learn how to use FindEssentialMat(), recoverPose(), triangulatePoints() and so on. In addtion, I made a viewer using OpenCV-Viz-Module. You can check it too.

### Version
This shows your opencv version.

### Panorama (Python)
It uses findHomography(), and seamlessCone() for blening. You can try with images in "test_images" folder.

### CameraCapture (Python)
Nothing to write.
